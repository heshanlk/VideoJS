Note that this CSS is NOT a good thing to leave as-is and should almost
definitely be overridden in your theme. Rather than leaving the videojs.css
file loading normally and then overriding it in your theme's style.css file,
you should override the entire file with the following process.

1) Copy videojs.css from videojs/theme/videojs.css to your theme's directory.

2) Open up your theme's .info file and add the line:

   styles[] = videojs.css

   Placing this file in a subdirectory will work also if you prefer not to have
   CSS files in the root of your theme directory.

3) Clear your Drupal caches at http://example.com/admin/settings/performance.
   Now your theme's videojs.css file will be loaded and the original one
   provided by videojs module will be ignored. Make any changes necessary to
   the videojs.css file within your theme.

Note that the default HTML output of videojs module is a standard template that
other "skins" may work with. It is highly suggest to not override the
videojs.tpl.php file and instead build all your custom theming on top of the
default HTML through CSS.
